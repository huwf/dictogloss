# TODO

This page has got general thoughts on what _exactly_ I want to achieve with this app. Dictogloss/testing is great, but
there are a wider range of things which could/should be possible.


* Speech to text is the central point of the app. This can be used for a variety of different situations
    * Dictogloss - capture a video of n x m seconds and listen repeatedly to each segment
    * Simple transcription of an audio file - easier than Google which is only available on API     
* Can we choose APIs for different languages?
    * How could this be priced in?
* Translation
    * Google already does this of course...
* File input needs to be intuitive, and not just from a URL
    * Files on the device
    *
